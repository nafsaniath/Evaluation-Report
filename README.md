# Evaluation-Report
## Process Evaluation of REACH Initiative (abbreviated)
This report presents an empirical evaluation of an active learning model: REACH, implemented in high enrollment
undergraduate courses at the University of Wisconsin Madison. The insights gained from data collected from multiple sources
(i.e., students, faculty, instructional designers, academic staff members) through document reviews, surveys, meetings, interviews
and focus group studies indicated, following a well-planned structured approach to transforming traditional courses to REACH-
‘active learning’ courses, the REACH model has been successfully implemented in many departments and colleges. The data
supports REACH’s acceptability and future sustainability across departments. The report reveals specific strengths of the model
as well as the areas to improve. It also provides specific recommendations on how to improve the model and ensure its
sustainability
